## Introduction
Solid State Tesla Coil uses transistor based swiching devices (instead of Spark Gap) to resonate the secondary coil with or without feedback. 
The both kinds of circuits (with and without feedback) were designed and tested.
The features of the SSTC are:
1. Feedback and without feedbnack Circuits
2. Variable duty cycle Interrupter
3. Music Interrupter to play music from SSTC
4. PCB Design

## Design
The design of the tesla coil is described below,
### Coil Design
1. Primary Coil
Primary Coil consist of 5mm copper pipe with 6 turns wound around the secondary with 3D printed support.
2. Secondary Coil
The secondary winding are wound around a 2-inch PVC water pipe with 36 gauge copper moter winding wire. The length of the pipe is around 25cm with winding height of 20cm. 5cm of PVC pipe is kept as a margin.
Around 1200 turns of described wire was winded.
3. 3D printed holder for coils
Using Fusion 360, the coil holder was designed. The files for the holder can also be downloaded from this github page.
